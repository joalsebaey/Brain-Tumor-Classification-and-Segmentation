# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection and Classification

## Overview
Brain tumors are among the most aggressive diseases, affecting both children and adults. Accounting for 85â€“90% of all primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors, early and accurate diagnosis is critical for improving patient outcomes. However, manual diagnosis through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be error-prone due to the complexities involved in interpreting tumor properties.

This project leverages **Deep Learning** techniques to automate the detection, classification, and segmentation of brain tumors. Using state-of-the-art models like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for classification and **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for segmentation, the system achieves remarkable performance, significantly aiding radiologists in accurate and efficient diagnoses.
